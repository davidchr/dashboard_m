# dashboard_m
A simple live dashboard that looks at Meetup's RSVP feed.

Meetup as per their website, is a service used to organize online groups that host in-person events for people with similar interests. The service also provides extensive API support for developers.

In this project, RSVP for each categories are counted live, as they are submitted by users on Meetup. Top categories are presented in a visual format.

Below is a recording of the working dashboard:
